# _Simone_

_Simone_ is a set of web interfaces for collective (local-)networked improvisation.

_Simone_ is a distributed instrument based on 2 concepts : using the microphone in the sound synthesis process, using the network to share information between users.

_Simone_ was developped using the [*soundworks*](https://github.com/collective-soundworks/soundworks/) framework.


## Installation

Install `Node.js` (LTS version)

Download the application 

Clone the repo or download it to the location you want on your computer then in the terminal: 

```
cd /path/to/simone
npm install
npm run build
```

## Starting the server

```
npm run start
```

This should start the server and prints several IP adresses like this: 

```
+ https server listening on
    https://127.0.0.1:8000
    https://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:8000
```

## Accessing a client

To access a client open your favorite web browser on your device (preferably Firefox or Chrome, latest version).

Then go to the address written in the terminal (the first one will only work on the device that started the server).

You'll have to give access to the microphone.

## Variations 

_Simone_ offers various improvisation scenarii that differ in the type of information shared by users and the role they assume.
